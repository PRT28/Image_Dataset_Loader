# Image_Dataset_Loader
This program loads image datasets to the corresponding features and labels

This function works over an image dataset with any number of categories. As the actual code is very tedious and hectic, so we build a module in order to cut down this code for you. All you have to do is just seperate image according to categories and save that in different folders and rest everything this code will do for you from processing to normalization and flattening of the image and finally appending it to X and Y accordingly.
